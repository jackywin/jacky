Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
